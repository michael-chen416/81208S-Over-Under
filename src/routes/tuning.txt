PID TUNING
Step 1: P (proportional)
    Start with a P value of approximately 0.1
    If the robot shakes while completing the task, begin reducing P value by approx. 10% each time, use your own judgement but 10% is ok 
    If the robot struggles to maintain the path, increase the P value by approx 20% each time 

Step 2: D (derivative)
    Start with a D value that is double of the P value
    If the robot spends too much time adjusting to target, decrease D by about 50%
    If the effect isn't noticable enough, increase D by about 10%

Step 3: I (integral)
    Good luck lmao
    imagine it as something that pushes it past a very small error
    try not to use it

Step 4: Timeout
    If you don't have time to properly tune, your PID function might never reach your target
    However I am a benevolent programmer and have created a timeout, where it exits the loop after "x" milliseconds have elapsed
    To access timeout, you have to overload for MP profiling, its built into turning functions

Step 5: Tolerance
    I am stupid it does not work properly
    Therefore, consider using a 1.0 to 5.0 inch tolerance 


MP TUNING
Step 1: MAX_VEL
    Use your judgement and think about how fast the robot should travel at max speed
    Usually this will be about 40-80 inches/second for long distance, maybe 20 for short distance
    
Step 2: MIN_VEL
    Minimum velocity should always be less than 3 inches/second
    If MIN_VEL = MAX_VEL, you have no acceleration/deceleration, which is the single edge case wehre MIN_VEL can be higher than 3

Step 3: DECEL_TIME
    Decel time should scale quadratically againt max velocity, check movement doc for an example of decent testing value, just don't input 0

Step 4: ACCEL_TIME
    Accel time can be whatever, just not 0

Step 5: offset
    MP is kind of weird where it always overshoots because its sort of like analog control, so we introduce an offset factor so we travel the "right" distance
    Inside the MP function it shortens the target distance by offset
    You kind of don't really need offset for most cases, but it should be used if you travel at like 60+ inch/s
